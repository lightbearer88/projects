## MIT Build-Your-Own-Radar
----------

This folder contains the analysis code for the MIT Build-Your-Own-Radar project, as detailed in [this website.](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ll-003-build-a-small-radar-system-capable-of-sensing-range-doppler-and-synthetic-aperture-radar-imaging-january-iap-2011/projects/) The original code is written in Matlab (stored in the matlab folder) but I wanted to use Python since it is more accessible. I have begun to translate some of the functions to Python and grouping them into a module, stored in the python folder.
